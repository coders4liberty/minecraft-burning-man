Burning Man on Minecraft

Welcome to Minecraft Burning Man by Coders for Liberty

During the LP primaries, the work of Judd Weiss was especially intriquing and interesting. To quote Judd Weiss, "we need to reimagine something better." While we can bicker all day about how the LP is going the wrong direction with the Johnson/Weld ticket, I find it much more constructive to work on something I am more passionate about. I care about the future. I care about education. I care about preparing young people for the future. I care about coding education. I believe that there are many parallels between coding and liberty. Mostly, they both require imagination. It is difficult to imagine a world with more liberty. It is also difficult to imagine yourself writing your first program or first line of code. 

While personally I find Scratch to be the best place to start for beginning coders, Python is a great next step in coding education. One game that has captured the imagination of the younger generation is Minecraft. To build on the Weiss theme which closely resembles that of Burning Man, I decided that our first project as Coders for Liberty is creating a Minecraft Burning Man using Python. 

There are a lot of resources that you can use to get started.
First there is the Minecraft Pi resources on Raspberry Pi's website: https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi/

To go more in-depth into the Minecraft programming, visit Stuff About Code http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft.html
and especially the API reference page http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft-api-reference.html

I personally use Minecraft Pi, which should come preloaded with most Raspberry Pi images out there. If not, you can follow the directions at RaspberryPi.org or at StuffAboutCode.com to install it.

I do not have the regular Minecraft. However, if you have regular Minecraft and would like to participate, you can use the Raspberry Juice plugin. http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2014/10/minecraft-raspberryjuice-and-canarymod.html

Then just download the minecraft-burning-man.py file and open it in your favorite IDE and start coding! 

Keep us updated about your progress. Create a branch and upload your code and start a pull request. 

Try not to inadvertantly build on top of someone else's creation.
